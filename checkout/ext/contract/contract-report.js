/*
 * karate-max paired-run report — the Alpine.js component behind ext/contract/pages/contract.html.
 * Reads window.KARATE_PAIR, which is VERBATIM what Contract.read returned (inlined as a <script> data
 * tag, so the page works off file:// and off a static site).
 *
 * The one rule this file obeys, and the reason it is thin: IT DERIVES NO CLAIM (D227f). Freshness, the
 * standing rung, the two halves of the proportion and every count come pre-computed from the verb that
 * owns them — a second implementation of what a pair means would eventually disagree with the first, and
 * the disagreement would surface as a claim nobody can attest. What is here is presentation only:
 * selecting, escaping, and the percentage rounding (floored, exactly as PairReport.pct does it, so the
 * page and the markdown never print two different numbers for one value).
